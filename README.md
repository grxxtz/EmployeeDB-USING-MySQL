This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational employee management database using MySQL. It includes structured SQL scripts for **database creation, table design, data insertion, and data manipulation**. The database schema is normalized with primary key constraints to ensure data integrity and efficient storage.

**Core SQL operations include:**

• Creating and managing relational tables using `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE`.
• Inserting structured data using `INSERT` statements.
• Performing data retrieval with conditional filtering using `SELECT` and `WHERE`.
• Updating records dynamically using `UPDATE`.
• Generating analytical insights using aggregate functions like `AVG()` along with `GROUP BY`.

The project highlights my understanding of **SQL fundamentals**, **database design**, **DML operations**, and **data analysis using relational queries**, making it suitable for handling employee records and generating department based salary insights.
